# Torus

Torus is an attempt to recreate Wallpaper Engine. This application allows you to display videos as your desktop wallpaper, similar to what Wallpaper Engine offers.

## Getting Started

To use Torus, you need to follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Download Source Code**: You need to download the entire source code for Torus.

2. **FFmpeg**: Torus relies on `ffmpeg` to process video files. Place the `ffmpeg.exe` executable in the same directory as the Torus executable.

### Installation

1. **Download Source Code**: Clone or download the source code from this repository.

2. **Place FFmpeg**: Ensure that `ffmpeg.exe` is located in the same directory as the Torus executable.

### Running Torus

- **Launch the Application**: Run the Torus executable to start the application.
- Select **Open File** and then select your desired video
- **Close the Application**: 
  - You can close Torus by pressing the shortcut key combination `Ctrl + Shift + Alt`.
  - Alternatively, you can manually close the application from the Task Manager.

## Notes

- Make sure that all required files, including `ffmpeg.exe`, are present in the application directory for it to function correctly.

- If you encounter issues, verify that `ffmpeg.exe` is correctly placed and that all dependencies are properly included.
